    <h1>Basketball</h1>

    <p style="font-size:25px;font-family:verdana;">Baskeball has been played since <em>December 21, 1891</em>, beginning in <strong>Springfield, Massachusetts</strong> and evolving
    into a sport played all across the United States, and more recently, all across the world.
    Now, High Schoolers, like myself, across the country love to play it. An estimated
    <a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-popular-high-school-sports-america-a68e565ca65541f7" target="_blank">939,836</a>
    student athletes, including both boys and girls play the sport.</p>

    <h1 style="color:SlateBlue;font-family:courier;">Rules</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>High level basketball games are usually either played in quarters of 12 minutes(<abbr title="National Basketball Associtation">NBA</abbr>)
            and in halves of 20 minutes(<abbr title="National Collegiate Athletic Associtation">NCAA</abbr>)</li>
        <li>In between the halves of these games, each team recieves 15 minutes as a halftime break</li>
        <li>If the score at the end of regulation(the end of the four 12 minute quarters or two 20 minute halves)
            is the same, the game will go into overtime, where an additional 5 minutes is played and until one of the teams scores
            higher than the other by the end of the overtime, additional overtimes will begin until one of the teams wins</li>
        <li>Each team has to shoot the ball within each possession at least once within 24 seconds but if you shoot and hit the rim the
            clock resets</li>
        <li>After a dribble, a player can take two steps before the player must dribble again. If he doesn't, it is a travel, which is a foul</li>
        <li>Fouls generally turn the ball over but there are shooting fouls where if you were fouled within the three point line, you get two
            free throws but if you were fouled outside the three point line you get to take three free throws</li>
        <li>THe referees are the ones who officiate the games and they call whether there was a foul or not.</li>


    </ul>

    <h1 style="color:Tomato;font-family:helvetica;"><abbr title="National Basketball Associtation">NBA</abbr></h1>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-family:Times;">The NBA is the most elite level of basketball. It is
    every young basketball player's dream to make it to the NBA. The NBA is responsible for popularizing some of
    pop cultures most notable names: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Allen Iverson. Fortunately for data
    analysts, statistics in the NBA are well documented, so when arguing over who is the <abbr title="Greatest of all time">GOAT,</abbr>
    which is a very popular topic to argue about amoung basketball fans, there can be some factual basis rather than pure bias. Here are some
    interesting all time statistics leaders expressed through tables.</p>
