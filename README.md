# basketballHtml

This is my basketball guide. In the guide, there is a lot of fun information surrownding basketball such as NBA(National Basketball Association) statistics leaders, rules and high school basketball information. 
The program is written in html5, and is a program used to practice the html language.

The advanced aspect that I am focusing on is tables. I have diffentiated each statistic in my table by color and I also added a bunch of different style tags to my table.
